## Sorting notes
### Bubble Sort
Benefit: Works well with nearly sorted array because it can be short circuited to stop once it makes a pass with no swaps.

### Selection Sort

### Insertion Sort
Benefit: Since it keeps the left side of the collection sorted, it can deal well with a collection that is growing (items pushed on the end of the array).
